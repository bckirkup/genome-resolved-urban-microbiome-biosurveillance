#  Genome-Resolved Urban Microbiome Biosurveillance

A fully integrated framework for **genome-resolved metagenomics**, **ecological modeling**, and **machine learning** designed to support microbial surveillance and risk assessment in urban environments.

This pipeline enables high-resolution tracking of pathogen-associated taxa across infrastructure types such as ambulances, hospital interiors, sewage systems, and public transport. It combines robust preprocessing, species-level ecological analytics, and predictive modeling to uncover microbial transmission patterns, contamination risks, and ecological vulnerability.

## What This Framework Offers

- **Genome-resolved profiling**: From raw reads to annotated MAGs with virulence and AMR gene screening.
-  **Ecological modeling**: Diversity analysis, indicator species detection, community structuring.
- **Machine learning diagnostics**: Environmental source prediction, entropy-based identity modeling, and composite risk scoring.
- **Simulation-based inference**: Synthetic community blending, ecological fragility assessment, and uncertainty quantification.

Built for reproducibility, explainability, and cross-environment comparability, this framework operationalizes biosurveillance as a diagnostic, data-driven process.
